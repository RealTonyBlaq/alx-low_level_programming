A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
We can store and add elements indefinitely in a linked list, perform insertion and deletion of data easily, unlike in arrays
doing such can be a tedious task. A linked list always contains a head - which is the first node in the list; and a tail, which is a node with a pointer that points to NULL.

This directory contains all my projects on singly linked lists as asssigned by ALX.
